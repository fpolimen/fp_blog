The next E e-services!

It was the vision from HP in late 90s for the digitalization of Business Services participating to an ecosystem based on open standards. 
I still remember the advertising in the main airports, far before web services, that few understood. 

It anticipated what today is the API Economy and was too early!

The vision was supported by the HP software proposition HP Netaction and the e-services were renamed as Web services. 
It included all the ingredients for the enablement of the ecosystem:

- HP E-speak communication framework, later replaced by the HP Web Services Platform based on SOAP protocol
- HP Process Manager for the orchestration of Business services
- HP UDDI Registry for the exposition of the Business services
- HP Application Server, formerly Bluestone, standard J2EE AS with a micro-services architecture for the implementation of the Business services
- HP JCA Connector Framework for the integration of legacy applications into the new Business services

We are almost implementing that vision today with different tools, and I believe that the serverless approach will be a key booster.
