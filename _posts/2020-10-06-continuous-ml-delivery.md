**Unfinished**

Many Digital Services will be embodied by Machine Learning and Deep Learning models trained on large datasets.

New assets, characterizing these services, must be tracked and versioned in the lifecycle, among others: 

 - **The dataset** used for the training
 - **The model** resulting from the training
 - **The KPI** achieved in the testing phase representing the expected  performance of the service on the new requests 

You can address the additional complexity, combining a software layer for the versioning of the service and all the related assets, with a continuous delivery method having a serverless environment as target for the deployment of the services.
