**Unfinished**

Many Digital Services will be embodied by Machine Learning and Deep Learning models trained on large datasets.

New assets, characterizing these services, must be tracked and versioned in the lifecycle: 

 - **The dataset** used for the training
 - **The model** resulting from the training
 - **The KPI** achieved in the testing phase representing the expected  performance of the service on the new requests 

You can address the additional complexity, combining a software layer for the versioning of the service and all the related assets, with a continuous delivery method having a serverless environment as target for the deployment of the services.
